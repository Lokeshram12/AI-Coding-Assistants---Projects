Perfect! Let’s break your **server-side Todo app** project into **clear, progressive stages** with learning objectives and AI-assisted prompt refinement in mind. I’ll keep it **simple and structured**, no code unless you ask.

---

## **Project:** Server-Side Todo App

**Tech Stack:** Node.js + Express.js + MongoDB (later)
**Endpoints:**

1. `POST /task` → Add task
2. `GET /task` → Retrieve/display tasks
3. `PUT /task/:id` → Update task
4. `DELETE /task/:id` → Delete task

---

## **Stage-wise Plan**

### **Stage 1: Simple On-the-Go (Reset on Refresh)**

**Goal:**

* Store tasks in memory (array/object)
* Tasks disappear when server restarts

**Learning Objectives:**

* Node.js + Express basics: server setup, routes, middleware
* Handling HTTP requests/responses
* Basic JSON data handling

**Prompt Example (plain English):**

> “I want to create a Node.js server with Express that can add, retrieve, update, and delete tasks stored in memory.”

**Milestones:**

1. Setup Express server
2. Create endpoints for CRUD operations
3. Store tasks in an in-memory array

---

### **Stage 2: Persist Data Locally**

**Goal:**

* Save tasks to a local file (JSON or text)
* Data persists across server restarts

**Learning Objectives:**

* File I/O in Node.js (fs module)
* Reading/writing JSON files
* Error handling

**Prompt Example:**

> “How do I save tasks in a local file so they don’t reset when the server restarts?”

**Milestones:**

1. Write new tasks to a file
2. Read tasks from the file at server startup
3. Update/delete tasks in the file

---

### **Stage 3: Use Cache**

**Goal:**

* Store tasks in memory cache (optional: Redis for future stage)
* Faster retrieval, can implement TTL if needed

**Learning Objectives:**

* Understanding caching concepts
* Using in-memory objects vs. Redis cache
* Performance improvement techniques

**Prompt Example:**

> “I want tasks to be stored in memory with optional expiration, so reads are fast.”

**Milestones:**

1. Implement in-memory caching
2. Optional: use Redis if installed
3. Ensure CRUD operations update cache

---

### **Stage 4: Persist in Database (MongoDB)**

**Goal:**

* Tasks stored in MongoDB for persistence
* Server fully functional with database

**Learning Objectives:**

* MongoDB CRUD operations (insert, find, update, delete)
* Connecting Express to MongoDB using Mongoose
* Understanding schema and models

**Prompt Example:**

> “I want my Express endpoints to store tasks in MongoDB and retrieve them.”

**Milestones:**

1. Define task schema
2. Connect Express app to MongoDB
3. Implement CRUD endpoints with DB

---

### **Stage 5: Multiple Users with Authentication (Optional)**

**Goal:**

* Multiple users can have their own tasks
* Authentication via JWT or simple tokens

**Learning Objectives:**

* User authentication basics (signup/login)
* JWT token usage in Node.js
* Associating tasks with users

**Prompt Example:**

> “How can I add basic user authentication so tasks are linked to each user?”

**Milestones:**

1. Add user signup/login endpoints
2. Protect task endpoints with token verification
3. Associate tasks with user ID

---

💡 **Key Notes:**

* Start simple (Stage 1), don’t jump to DB/Redis initially.
* At each stage, refine your **plain-English prompt** based on what you want the AI to guide you on.
* You’ll gradually learn **Express routing, Node.js async programming, file I/O, caching, database integration, and authentication**.

---

If you want, I can **create a clean “prompt + milestone” table for all 5 stages**, so you can just use it as a roadmap with AI guidance. This will make it extremely **easy to follow and ask AI for help at each stage**.

Do you want me to do that?
